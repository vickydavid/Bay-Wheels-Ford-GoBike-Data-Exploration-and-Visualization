## Key Insights for Presentation

There is a much difference between the casual and subsriber ride usage pattern according to the analysis subscribers use bikes for shorter duration while casual riders use bikes for longer duration mostly on Saturday and Sunday while the pattern of subscribers is somehow same all the week.
